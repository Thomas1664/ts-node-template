# ts-node-template

This is boilerplate code for creating Typescript projects in a Node environment.
After following  the instructions you will have the basic functionality to run a Typescript project with `ts-node` included to your project folder.

# Description

This template repo contains basic debug launch configuration for VS Code using `index.ts` as entry point. If you don't use VS Code as IDE, remove the folder `.vscode`. The file `tsconfig.json` includes basic configuration for the Typescript compiler used by `ts-node`.

# Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Initialize npm: `npm init -y`
2. Globally install `typescript` and `ts-node`: `npm i -g typescript ts-node`
3. Install `typescript` and `ts-node` as local dev-dependencies: `npm i -D typescript ts-node`
4. Launch the scipt via `ts-node index.ts`

Feel free to remove this `README.md` file after installation!
